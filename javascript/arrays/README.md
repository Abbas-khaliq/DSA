## How to Run

Each JavaScript file can be run using Node.js:

```bash
node arrays/01_basic_array_operations.js
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with `01_basic_array_operations.js` to understand the fundamentals
2. Practice the basic operations until you're comfortable
3. Move on to advanced array methods
4. Study and implement common array algorithms
5. Learn and implement sorting and searching algorithms

## Tips for Learning

1. Read the comments carefully - they explain the logic and time complexity
2. Try to modify the code and experiment with different inputs
3. Understand the time complexity analysis for each operation
4. Practice implementing these operations without looking at the code
5. Try to solve the upcoming problems before looking at the solutions
